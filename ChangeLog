		reduce the likehood of hash collisions.
	globaldefs.h ziproxylogtool.c:

		Should still compile with not-so-old previous libpng
		versions.
	cfgfile.* netd.c:
		Added support for simultaneous user connection limit.

	image.c:
		Under certain circumstances, certain PNG pictures
		could not be decompressed. Fixed.
		This bug affected certain architectures, such as x86-64.
	cfgfile.c qparser.*:
		Added support for errors informing about obsoleted
		configuration parameters, instead of just erring
		as if it was a mere syntax error.
		Obsolete parameters from previous versions were added.
	cfgfile.c qparser.*:
		Added support for errors informing about unsupported
		configuration parameters (eg. features disabled
		during compilation), instead of just erring
		as if it was a mere syntax error.
		Added JP2K-related parameters to this list.
	cfgfile.* log.c netd.c:
		Obsoleted LogPipe option and removed all related code.
	cfgfile.c log.* netd.c text.c tosmarking.h ziproxy.c:

		to improve code readability in general.
		New option: DebugLog
	JPEG2000.ru.txt README.ru README.tools.ru
	ziproxylogtool.ru.1 ziproxy.ru.1:
		Removed all Russian translations, due to lack of maintainer.
	change_tos.list:
		Added example file for TOSMarkAsDiffURL option.
	cfgfile.* http.c:

		Renamed parameter "AccessLogFileName" to "AccessLog".
		Deprecated option: AccessLogFileName (still functional)
		New option: AccessLog
	cttables.c misc.*:
		cttables was case-sensitive, that's against
		RFC 1049 (RFC 1341). Fixed.
	cfgfile.* http.c:
		Added switch for "x-" subtype prefix matching for
		content-type lists.
		Migrated URLReplaceDataCTList to new content-type
		lists subsystem.
		New options: TOSMarkAsDiffCTAlsoXST,

		             LosslessCompressCTAlsoXST
	gzpipe.* http.* image.* log.* simplelist.c text.*
	tosmarking.* globaldefs.h:
		Changed filesize counter from signed int (usually 32 bits,
		even in 64-bit architectures) to a local type (defined
		during compile time, being that	at least 64 bits).
		The most perpectible effect is seen in logs (no longer
		wrong, often negative, size numbers for anything > 2GB).
		This also fixes the data size limitation (up to 2GB) in
		cases where Content-Lenght was used such as
		HTTP method CONNECT, URLNoProcessing.
	gzpipe.c log.* ziproxy.c ziproxy.conf:
		Added 'G' flag support to AccessLog.

	cfgfile.c ziproxy.conf:
		Changed default of MinUncompressedGzipStreamEval from
		250000 (~250kB) to 10000000 (~10MB).
		This avoids trigging of MaxUncompressedGzipRatio if
		ISO9660 images are compressed while streaming (the
		first MBs of ISOs are highly compressible).
	cfgfile.c ziproxy.conf:
		Added "application/iso9660-image" content-type as
		compressible (losslessly), in default settings.
	log.c globaldefs.h:
		Changed time measurement from signed int (usually 32 bits,
		even in 64-bit architectures) to a local type (defined
		during compile time, being that at least 64 bits).
		Fixes problems of time logging of long downloads (>2G
		microseconds, or >35 minutes) which previously gave
		wrong, often negative, times.
	cfgfile.* image.c log.* netd.c ziproxy.conf:
		Implemented an internal error-message handling system.
		Added more verbosity to error/warning conditions.
		Previously unreported errors now appear.
		Minor fixes in cfgfile.*.
		Some code reorganization in log.*.
		New option: ErrorLog
		Obsoleted option: MSIETest
	README src/*:
		Updated copyright year to current one.

14.12.2009 Daniel Mealha Cabrita

	README* image.* ziproxy.* netd.* ziproxy_genhtml_stats.sh:
		Fixed Juraj's copyright years, considering old
		code from 2002.

	version 2.7.1
	http.c:
		Fixed HTTP/0.9 simple response support,
		which was broken for aeons and nobody noticed.
	text.c:
		Gunzipped data smaller than the compressed was
		being treated as corruped and data was simply
		forwarded as is.
		But that's not necessarily true (a certain website
		thought it was a good idea to gzip jpegs, for example)
		and in certain cases processing was not
		applied because of that. Fixed.
	http.c:
		Implemented workaround for buggy sites which send:
		Content-Encoding: ISO-8859-1 (violates RFC 2616).
		Fixes certain pages which appeared as binary garbage
		in the browser.

13.4.2009 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.7.0
	README.ru:
		Added note stating this documentation is

	image.* cfgfile.* http.c log.* ziproxy.c:
		Added feature against "image bomb" DoS.
		New option: MaxUncompressedImageRatio
	image.c:
		Fixed bug in rgb2yuv converter. In certain cases jp2
		pictures had some very wrong colors (like deep red turned
		into strong pink etc).
	cfgfile.* http.* image.c text.* txtfiletools.c ziproxy.c:
		Obsoleted ModifySuffixes. It was buggy and lost its
		usefulness a long ago.
		The following config options are obsolete:
		ModifySuffixes,	MinTextStream
		The following files were removed:
		cfgtest.c
		htmlmodify.h
		htmlmodify_jp2.l
		htmlmodify.l
		imgtest.c
		Makefile
		modifytest.c
		Also, additional code cleanup was done.
		Test programs were obsolete and were
		removed (imgtest, modifytest, cfgtest)
		and no longer are a build option.
		Flex is no longer required for building Ziproxy.
	cfgfile.c:
		Preventive bugfix (did not cause problems yet).
	cfgfile.* http.c:

	version 2.6.9_BETA
	cfgfile.* http.c:
		Added support for custom 403 error pages.
	http.* ziproxy.c:
		Fixed the type/signedness mess with outgoing Port vars.
		Ports >= 32768 were not accessible.
		Non-standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (non-80/443) were not
		accessible in big-endian architectures.
	cfgfile.* http.* ziproxy.c:
		Added provision for outgoing port restrictions.
		New options: RestrictOutPortHTTP, RestrictOutPortCONNECT
	cfgfile.c ziproxy.conf:
		Changed JPG and JP2K default settings to (hopefully)
		better values.
	image.c:
		Bug which prevented recompression to jp2k
		when more aggressive parameters were set to
		color components, original image was forwarded
		instead. Fixed.
	jp2tools.* cfgfile.*:
		Added Lanczos component upsampler support to JP2k.
		New option: JP2Upsampler
	image.c:
		Encoding/decoding jp2 images with alpha channel
		always fails. Fixed.

		pages.
	http.c:
		Under random conditions or unrelated configuration
		changes the pictures were not recompressed.
		Fixed.
	http.c embbin.h:
		Changed from 1x1 PNG to 1x1 GIF due to smaller
		size of the latter.

2.9.2008 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.5.9_BETA
	http.c cfgfile.* replace.list embbin.h:
		Added support for data replacement using
		a URL list.
		New option: URLReplaceData
	http.c auth.* log.*:
		Now a authenticated connection also logs the
		username alongside its IP (username@X.X.X.X).
	ziproxy.c simplelist.* cfgfile.* bo_exception.list:
		Added support for host exception list when
		using the BindOutgoing option.
		New options: BindOutgoingExList, BindOutgoingExAddr

31.3.2008 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.5.2
	http.c:
		Proxy authentication would bring access denial
		if such was not requested by Ziproxy (that means
		unnecessary authentication).
		Now it is simply ignored and access is normal.
	http.c:
		Ziproxy did not send the proper URL to the
		server (so it failed) when connecting to another proxy
		_and_ the client accessed Ziproxy in transparent
		proxy mode. Fixed.

10.3.2008 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.5.1
	http.c:
		Originally gzipped data, one not processable,
		to a client which supports gzip was being loaded
		wholly into memory then recompressed back.
		Now it's streamed directly to the client.
		(thus less latency)

28.1.2008 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.5.0
	image.c:
		JP2 component bitdepth set as !=8 would make
		the process crash. Fixed.
	cfgfile.c:
		Certain defaults were unoptimal. Fixed.
	ziproxy.conf:
		Reorganized example configuration file,
		clearer to read now.

16.1.2008 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.4.8_BETA2
	man/*:
		Added manpages for ziproxy and ziproxylogtools.
	http.* ziproxy.c txtfiletools.* urltables.* qparser.c:
                Added support for list of URLs that should not be
                processed by Ziproxy (due to bugs/incompatibilities).
                New option: URLNoProcessing
	ziproxy.conf:
		ATTENTION: Changed the default location of
		ziproxy.conf to /etc/ziproxy/ziproxy.conf
		(was /etc/ziproxy.conf)
	noprocess.list:
		Added example configuration file.
	auth.* strtables.* urltables.* http.c:
		Routines for (basic) authentication mostly
		rewritten.
		Perceptible site-effect: comments are now
		allowed in http.passwd file.

7.1.2008 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.4.8_BETA
	image.c http.c cfgfile.*:
		Added input processing for JPEG 2000 files.
		Previously Ziproxy could only compress to that
		format. Now it is able to recompress and
		even convert to other formats.
		Now it is possible to compile with JP2K support
		and disable that through the config file.
		New options: ProcessJP2K, ForceOutputNoJP2K, ProcessToJP2K
	image.c:
		Major optimizations to the existing JP2K code
		(the compression-to-JP2K code).
	http.c:
		Streaming data (no Content-Length) could be prematurely
		interrupted in certain cases. Fixed.
	image.* http.c cfgfile.*:
		Added support for YUV color model for JP2K files.
		New option: JP2Colorspace
	image.* http.c cfgfile.*:
		Added support for component and individual component
		resolution (bit-wise) for JP2K files.
		New options: JP2BitResYA, JP2BitResRGBA, JP2BitResYUVA
	image.* cfgfile.*:
		Now JP2K compression is specified in a similar way
		as JPG files (quality-wise, instead of rate).
		New option: JP2ImageQuality
		Obsoleted option: JP2Rate
	image.* cfgfile.* jp2tools.*:
		Added suport for component sampling.
		New options: JP2CSamplingYA, JP2CSamplingRGBA, JP2CSamplingYUVA
	image.* cfgfile.* http.c:
		Added switches for selective JP2 output support.
		New options: AnnounceJP2Capability, JP2OutRequiresExpCap
	JPEG2000.txt:
		Rewritten from scratch.

15.12.2007 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
        version 2.4.3
        Special version with urgent bugfix backport.
        This version is not present in CVS repository as is.
        http.c:
                Streaming data (no Content-Length) could be prematurely
                interrupted in certain cases. Fixed.

4.12.2007 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.4.2
	http.c:
		Fixed broken user pipe detection while transferring
		unprocessed stream-to-stream.
	ziproxy.c log.*:
		When server breaks the connection, ziproxy immediately
		interrupted the transfer at client's side.
		Now it will send the remaining data to the client.
		The previous behavior could bring premature
		disconnections.
	text.c:
		Content-Length wasn't being removed while
		stream-to-stream gunzipping. Fixed.
	ziproxy.c log.c:
		Ziproxy crashed when AccessLogFileName wasn't defined.
		Fixed. This bug appeared in 2.4.1 version.
	ziproxy.c log.*:
		Now (debug) log provides each line with the PID of the
		specific process servicing the specific HTTP request.
		Previously it merely provided the base Ziproxy process,
		what is pretty much useless in daemon mode and made
		sense only while using (x)inetd, or in pre-1.9.0 versions.
	http.c:
		Stream-to-stream (no further processing) routines were
		rewritten and are >100x times faster now. This may bring
		noticeable difference in cases where outgoing data
		is something like 10 Mbps or more.
		Added access log flag 'W'.

22.11.2007 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.4.1
	cfgfile.* netd.c ziproxy.*:
		New option: BindOutgoing
	cfgfile.* http.c:
		New option: AccessLogUserPOV
	ziproxy.conf:
		Added new xml types as (gzip) compressible.
		Added 'pdf' and 'tar' as compressible application types.
	gzpipe.c ziproxy.c http.* log.*:
		Added access log support for interrupted/timeouted transfers.
		Added access log flags 'Z' (timeout)
		and 'B' (broken pipe, interrupted)
	image.c:
		When decompressing jpeg incomplete files, ziproxy process
		crashes (busy loops) until it timeouts. Fixed.

28.10.2007 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.4.0
	http.*:
		If data is > MaxSize, junk was appended to the beginning
		of it. Fixed.
		Ziproxy tried to load into memory, data types which are
		not supposed to be processed. Fixed.
	text.c:
		Trivial overflow problem which gave false positives
		for "gunzip threshold limit". Fixed.
	qparser.c:
		When config file was essentially empty (only comments
		or spaces) ziproxy issues this error:
		ERROR: Invalid parameter --> <empty>
		Fixed.
	gzpipe.c:
		Fixed intermitent bug when gzip-streaming pages
		(random numbers appeared in the body of the page, mixed
		with the content). This bug appeared in 2.3.5_BETA.
	cfgfile.* http.c gzpipe.*:
		New option: MinUncompressedGzipStreamEval
	htmlopt.* http.c fstring.* cdetect.*:
		Added support for javascript files as text/javascript.
		Now tests whether text/html is indeed html
		(not always the case, may be JS, CSS...)
		Misc fixes to html opt (support more sites now).

25.10.2007 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.3.5_BETA
	http.c:
		Broken gzip were not being uncompressed (that's ok)
		but Ziproxy attempted to recompress those again. Fixed.
	http.c:
		Requests were broken when in transparent proxy mode _and_
		the client explicited the port. Fixed.
	various_files:
		Fixed missing includes and certain inconsistencies in the
		source code.
		Removed unused variables.
		Fixed (hopefully) all pointer compares in order to use NULL
		instead of 0.
		Those potentially preventing compilation in
		certain systems.
	qparser.*:
		Replaced libconfuse with qparser, thus that library is
		no longer used.
		Fixes x86_64 (and possibly other arches) parsing problems.
	configure.in:
		Now check all headers used in source code.
	http.* cfgfile.*:
		New option: WA_MSIE_FriendlyErrMsgs
		Misc bug fixes and code cleanup.
		MinTextStream was using the decompressed size, what is
		senseless if the data came pre-compressed by the remote
		server. Fixed.
	http.*:
		Added (limited) support for partial data download
		(Content-Range, Range).
		"multipart/byteranges" mode works aswell (as side effect),
		and that's a BUG. This must be disabled later
		since it can build corrupt data at the user's end
		(when dealing with jpg/gif/png and htmlopt-processed files).
	http.* text.* gzpipe.*:
		Added gzip/gunzip stream-to-stream support. Appliable
		when no other optimizations are requested/viable.
		Now logs aloways report gzipped transfers new sizes
		(previously, streaming cases were reported as "-1").
		A number of bugs fixed related to incoming gzipped data.
	cfgfile.c ziproxy.conf:
		Misc updates/improvements to the example config file.
		Changed some defaults to more sensible values.

11.9.2007 Daniel Mealha Cabrita
	version 2.3.0
	ziproxy.c:
		Alternative network code for IPv4-only OSes was
		completely broken. Fixed.
	htmlopt.c:
		Broken commented CDATA in JS processing.
		Some pages using htmlopt were rendered broken.
		Fixed.
	http.c, cfgfile.*:
		New option: AllowMethodCONNECT
	http.c:
		(default) error messages now contain some
		meaningful info at the footer of the page,
		like date and hostname.
	http.* text.* cfgfile.*:
		Ziproxy now supports internal processing of
		gzipped data.
		Now also possible to always advertise gzip capability,
		no longer being dependant on the http client.
		New option: OverrideAcceptEncoding
		New option: MaxUncompressedGzipRatio
